<h1>The Best Movies According to Aleena</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Iron Man Series</h3>
<p>My favourite movies of my favourite actor Robert Downey Junior. I love the science and action incorporated in the movies, and I love the personality and character development of Tony Stark.</p>
<h3>The Hitman's Bodyguard</h3>
<p>A great combination of comedy, action and a friendship that bloomed out of circumstances. I have watched it more than 5 times.</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>An amazing and motivational Bollywood movie, that stresses on the point that we must always follow our heart and pursue our passions. It also serves to shed light on some of the conventional Indian attitudes of forcing children to only pursue either Medical or Engineering fields as they think those are the only paths to a successful career, and of memorizing and studying to only gain top scores in exams and have a high rank in schools and colleges. This movie gives a lovely insight on the value of good education as well as understanding a child's innate skills and talents and allowing them to freely pursue them.</p>
