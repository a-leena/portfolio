<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  My name is Aleena. I'm an Indian hailing from the state of Kerala. I'm a third-year computer science and engineering
  student at VIT, Vellore, in Tamil Nadu, India. Currently, I am on a three-month break, residing with my parents in
  Jakarta, Indonesia, for exploring my true passions and dreams for my future. While spending most of the time being
  engaged in my favourite hobbies of reading, writing and swimming, I decided to also stay in touch with my
  Computer-Science skills, hence this portfolio.
